# Godot minigames

A small collection of some 2D minigames I made in the Godot gaming engine. The games are written in GDScript, a Python-like scripting language for Godot, with assets also created by me. The repository includes exports to several platforms for each of the games, but are also hosted as HTML5 and can be played on [itch.io](https://kateten.itch.io/) or where it is embedded on my [GitHub pages.](https://rissadr.github.io/projects.html)
